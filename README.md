# Design of a Bone Conduction Military Helmet

## Course Project for ME 423 [Machine Design]

## Overview

Human Auditory nerve, which takes audio signals from cochlea to the brain, is connected to the Organ of Corti in cochlea which is located on the basilar membrane. Therefore the displacement at the basilar membrane directly affects the sound we hear. This basilar membrane can be stimulated in 2 ways:
● Air Conduction: Normal Hearing through eardrum vibrations transmitted via middle ear bones (malleus, incus, and stapes).
● Bone Conduction: Vibrations transmitted through the skull.
The way we hear our own voice even after closing our ears is through bone conduction. Bone conduction also occurs in our Normal Hearing state through the skull but the stimulation on the basilar membrane is extremely low below 100 dB. Above 100 dB we can hear the sound even if we close our ears using ear plugs which is due to bone conduction.

### Working Principle

In this report, bone conduction phenomenon is studied and a bone conduction helmet is designed. The major use of this helmet is for military purposes where the soldier needs to hear the surrounding noises as well as clearly hear the commands from his officer.
